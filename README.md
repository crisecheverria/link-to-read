## Link2Read

This project is beacuse my necessity of saving Links that I want to read later. I was sending me emails to my self everytime I want to save a link, and that was creating unnecesary emails, then also it was having hard time searching for an specific link.

Also this came from an similiar project from a co-worker who already has His own Link2Read chrome extension for personal use. So I decided to create something similar, but using React and Hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
